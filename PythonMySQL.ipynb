    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "In this section you will learn: \n",
    "1. How to use MySQL with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this section, you will need: \n",
    "1. To know intermediate Python - [Python Workshop](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop)\n",
    "2. To be familiar with basic SQL concepts and syntax - [Intro to SQL](SQLBeginner.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "MySQL is a popular, open-source relational database management system backed by Oracle. You would need to use SQL, a query language, to communicate with the relational database. However, MySQL allows you to connect the SQL language with Python, a procedural language. In this section you will learn how to connect to a MySQL database and perform some SQL operations using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up The Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to install the MySQL server. There is a free version of MySQL that you can install on your local machines if you'd like, but here, we can install it within this Google Colab notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following code to install MySQL, and wait for the installation to complete. "

Calling the `execute()` function itself will not list out the databases.
